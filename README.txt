*** Kyonides's Gosu Fork ***
(C) 2019 Extended by Kyonides Arkanthes <kyonides@gmail.com>

Obviously Gosu's code actually belong to Julian Raschke and other contributors.

I tentantively named it Gosu version 0.15.1 after making slight changes in a
few files.

** INSTRUCTIONS **

Create a build directory and place the Makefile there. Later run make in your
favorite terminal window alias command prompt to build the rubygem.
